A new thread Thread_0 is created by the main thread and it starts execution.
In the run method, Thread_0 creates two more threads namely Thread_1 and Thread_2. 

Thread_0 returns and terminates. 

Thread_1 initialises and Thread_2 initialises. Thread_2 goes into the synchronised block as it has the key. Thread_2 enters the if block ( counter value being zero ), and sets the counter to 1. After that, it goes into the wait state. 

Thread_1 comes into the synchronised block and does not enter the if block since the counter value has been modified and set to 1. Thread_1 completes its execution and after its completion, the waiting Thread_2 is notified and Thread_2 completes its execution thereby producing the output 2112.
