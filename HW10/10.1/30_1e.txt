A new thread Thread_0 is created by the main thread and it starts execution.
In the run method, Thread_0 creates Thread_1 and sleeps for 100ms. 


Thread_1 goes into the synchronised block as it has the key. prints id, then enters try block and sleeps for 200ms. Until then Thread_2 gets initialised and enters the synchronised block as it's a new object it goes to if block ( counter value being zero ), and sets the counter to 1. After that, it goes into sleep for 200ms

Thread_1 enters if block and since the object was changed it gives an exeception.

Thread_2 completes sleep enters else block and exits
